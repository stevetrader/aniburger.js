#Animated Bootstrap Menu(Burger) Icon

Blog post with demo: http://stevetrader.com/posts/aniburger.html

##Usage:

Add `<script src="aniburger.js"></script>` just before the closing `</body>` tag for your site.  All CSS required will be automatically injected into the header, so no need to play with anything else.
